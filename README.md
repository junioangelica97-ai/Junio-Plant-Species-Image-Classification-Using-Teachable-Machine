# Junio-Plant-Species-Image-Classification-Using-Teachable-Machine

A. Project Overview
Brief Description of the Project
This project aims to develop an image classification system for mangrove species using Teachable Machine, a web-based tool that leverages machine learning for easy model creation. Users can train the model by providing images of different mangrove species, allowing the system to recognize and classify them accurately. This project helps in biodiversity monitoring, environmental conservation, and educational purposes by enabling quick identification of mangrove species through photos. It also demonstrates how accessible machine learning tools can be applied to ecological studies.

Purpose of the image classification model
The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify and differentiate mangrove species from images, providing a fast and accurate way to support environmental monitoring, conservation efforts, and educational activities. It aims to assist researchers, students, and environmentalists in recognizing mangrove species without requiring extensive botanical expertise, making species identification more efficient and accessible.
